Hosted on github, you can visit [here](https://crofrank.github.io/daily-tasks/)

### About app

Your To Do list where you can manage your daily tasks, mark it as completed when you finish with task and delete them all at the end of a day so you can write new goals for the next day.

### I used:

- CSS framework BOOTSTRAP,
- JS/TS,
- DOM manipulation,
- LocalStorage - web storage API,
- JSON

### Try it out

App is live and hosted on Github and link is on top of Readme file. If you want code on your local machine, you can use "git clone" and once you have it locally I suggest to run in with "Live Server" (VS code extension is easiest way).

### Localstorage

A web storage API provided by web browsers that allows web applications to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser.
Data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It remains stored until explicitly cleared by the user or the application.
